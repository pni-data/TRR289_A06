# TRR289 A06

## ℹ️ Information
*This repository is the Github sibling of the corresponding [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) dataset, i.e. it **does not** contain the data itself.*
The GitHub sibling, nevertheless, provides insights into the general data structure (directory tree, filenames) and serves as a starting point to download, share and discuss the dataset.
 Data is in BIDS format and may include behavioral, questionnaire and derivative data, too.
Data is stored in a special S3 remote provided by [Coscine](https://coscine.rwth-aachen.de/) and can't be downloaded without the dataset specific secret token.
Token is available at project Z03 for members of TRR289 and collaborators upon reasonable request.

See `dataset_description.json` for project related meta-data.

## ⬇️ How to download dataset

#### 1. Install it with DataLad based on the github handle
This does not download the actual data, only the gin-annex "skeleton".
```bash
datalad install -s git@github.com:pni-data/<dataset_name>.git <dataset_name>
```
#### 2. Set up the security token to access the actual data
Token is available at project Z03 for members of TRR289 and collaborators upon reasonable request.
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="XXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="XXXXXXXX"
```

#### 2. Change to the dataset directory and download the file(s) you want
You can selectively download what you need (e.g. derivatives only).
```bash
cd <dataset_name>
datalad get <path/to/file*>
```
